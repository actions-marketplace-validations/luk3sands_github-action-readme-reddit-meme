# README.md Reddit Meme

[//]: # (![workflow]&#40;https://github.com/d3code/github-action-commit-workflow-changes/actions/workflows/action.yaml/badge.svg&#41;)

This action gets the latest post with an image from the `r/ProgrammerHumor` subreddit and updates your `README.md`

Place an image with the description `![Reddit]` in your readme and the action will replace it with the latest from the Reddit API and commit it to the branch the action was run on. Make sure you have `Read and write workflow permissions` for the repository you are running this action on.

You can optionally change the commit author and email if you wish to. This will default to:
```yaml
  with:
    commit_author: GitHub Actions
    commit_email: github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com
```

### Example workflow

Updates at 6am every day and on push to master

```yaml

    branches: [ master ]

    - cron: '0 6 * * *'
